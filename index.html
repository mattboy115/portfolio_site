		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I love a challenge.</p> <p>That's why I decided to become a programmer. It challenges me every day and I love it.</p>
		<p>In my spare time I play video games, narrate horror stories on YouTube, listen to music, practice speed solving techniques for the Rubik's Cube, and design web pages for fun.</p>
